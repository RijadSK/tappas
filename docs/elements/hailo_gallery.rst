Hailo Gallery
==============

Overview
--------

HailoGallery is an element which enables the user to save and compare embeddings (HailoMatrix) that represents recogintion, in order to track objects across multiple streams.
It is also enables saving and loading these embeddings into a local JSON file (database like), in order to track pre-saved objects.

Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

The hailogallery element provides a series of properties that allow you to adjust the gallery comparison algorithm. The most important property to set is ``class-id``\ : this determines if the gallery will track all `HailoDetection <../write_your_own_application/hailo-objects-api.rst#hailodetection>`_ objects indiscriminately of class or focus only on detections of a specific class id (the default behavior is to track across-classes).
