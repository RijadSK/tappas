Raspberry Pi GStreamer based applications
=========================================

Where should I start?
---------------------

That's a great question! Hailo provides a `Sanity Pipeline <sanity_pipeline/README.rst>`_ that helps you verify that the installation phase went well. This is a good starting point.


#. `Sanity Pipeline <sanity_pipeline/README.rst>`_ - Helps you verify that all the required components are installed correctly
#. `Detection <detection/README.rst>`_ - single-stream object detection pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
#. `Depth Estimation <depth_estimation/README.rst>`_ - single-stream depth estimation pipeline on top of GStreamer using the Hailo-8 device.
